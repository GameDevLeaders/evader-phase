# Evader Phase

This is a prototype for the NS Game Devs group.

Basically you only need to evade the enemies, when an enemy collides with your ship the game ends, so you need to refresh the browser. 

Remember it's a prototype!


## Instalation

You need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [bower](http://bower.io/)
